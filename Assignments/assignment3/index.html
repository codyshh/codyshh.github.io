        <h2><p>There are many types of monsters that scare me:</h2> 
           <h3> <ul><li>monsters who cause trouble without showing themselves</li> <li>monsters who abduct children</li> <li>monsters who devour dreams</li> <li>monsters who suck blood</li> </ul></h3><br>
            <h4> and then, monsters who tell nothing but lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance: <em>They are much more cunning than others.</em> </p></h4>
    <h5> <p>They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart; they eat even though they've never experienced hunger; they study even though they have no interest in academics; they seek friendship even though they do not know how to love.</p> </h5>
     <h6>      <p>If I were to encounter such monsters, I would likely be eaten by them... because in truth, I am that <em>monster.</em></p></h6>
