      A cartoonist, illustrator, and graphic novelist. Hanselmann is best known for his series Megg, Mogg, and Owl, which is available on Vice.com. Hanselmann's work deals with themes of trauma, addiction, death, and disillusionment. His characters are painfully realistic, despite their anthropomophic forms, and he often draws on his own reality for inspiration.

    <p>Relax. Art doesnâ€™t always have to be pretty or good, sometimes the best art tells a story. A gross, disgusting, really innapropriate one. These are lessons we can learn from Simon Hanselmann. Draw a bad day well, or a good day badly. Think about the consequences.  </p>
